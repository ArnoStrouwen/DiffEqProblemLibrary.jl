DiffEqProblemLibrary.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It premade
problems for the differential equations solvers. These can either be used as tests
or as examples to show how to use the the solvers. Check out the problems in the
src directory. Users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
